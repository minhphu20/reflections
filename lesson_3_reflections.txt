When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

>>To be able to share it with someone else -- for example your advisor or the public (open source software lalala)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>>because you might not want to share everything that is under development with the world/your collaborator

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

>> fork is to clone a repository of someone on github to your github. because you don't have permission to change the repo of this person, and you also want to acknowledge the person for their work

    clone is just to make a copy of a repo from github/local to local
    branch is just to create a branch on a repo -- what else can i say? it is to keep
    things clean as you develop or explore new features, can always switch to focus and also have a production line ready branch


Useful commands:
git remote (-v): see the exisiting remotes (verbose: to check the url you will push data to and pull data from)
git remote add name_of_remote_to_add
eg: git remote add origin url 
git push remote_that_you_want_to_send_changes_to name_of_local_branch_you_want_to_push

forking a repository (ie clone from github to github)
