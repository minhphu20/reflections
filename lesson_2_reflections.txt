when I initialized a git repository, no commit is made, a .git file is created inside the directory.

the staging area allow you to move things that can be committed from the working directory 
into the repository all at once

however, if i remove things from the staging area, it disappears!!

branches would keep my history organized when I want to try out a new features for examples that I am not entirely sure will be working
