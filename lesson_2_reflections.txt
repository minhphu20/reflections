when I initialized a git repository, no commit is made, a .git file is created inside the directory.

the staging area allow you to move things that can be committed from the working directory 
into the repository all at once

however, if i remove things from the staging area, it disappears!!

branches would keep my history organized when I want to try out a new features for examples that I am not entirely sure will be working

you can have a development branch when a lot of the development work is going on

you can also have a experimental branch

also good for collaborating with yourself -- context switch~

the diagram is essentially the branch structure

each branch is a name, you can linearly go back in time, but you can jump to the next branch

if you go back and do not create a branch, but then you commit, then the commit is not reachable from any branch, maybe should do git checkout -b new_branch_name in order to do
git branch new_branch_name and git checkout new_branch_name to save the commits you make 
from now on
