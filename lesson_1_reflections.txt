use diff -u file1 file2 in order to compare the difference between the two files
(in windows we can use fc)

use version control to have access to history of file

having automatic commit means you don't have to think about it
however, issuing your own commit (one per logical change) is a good way 
to keep track of your work and make incremental improvement without
worrying that you mess something up

some version control system, like Git, allows saving multiple files in one commit because 
these files are related to each other -- this is good! :)

the changes from one commit will show in the next version -- most recent on top!

command - shift - h will bring you in finder to your home directory

when you have version control, even if you break something, you can always revert back to
the original working version :)

I have set up git. I want to use it to do version control for all of my codes!!
